The shaking in my hands
Will they ever quit
I'm near the door
I just have to open it
Will you recognize my face
When you see me in the light
If you feel out of place
Maybe this can make it right
I could wear the dress
You used to know
When my innocence
Was not for show
If I could punch your heart you'd dir
I'd put back every star
I've lost the heart to shine
Because I let you go
Telephones have a way of changing lives
When I heard your voice
I sat there paralysed
Then I pictured your grin that night
The tears could not erase
What tonight will find
I don't know but just in case
I could wear the dress
You used to know
When my innocence
Was not for show
If I could punch your heart you'd dir
I'd put back every star
I've lost the heart to shine
Because I let you go
And now you're just on the other side
And I'm so scared I just wanna run and hide
I don't know what I will say to you
But darling I know something that will give you a clue
I could wear the dress
You used to know
When my innocence
Was not for show
If I could punch your heart you'd dir
I'd put back every star
I've lost the heart to shine
Because I let you go
I could wear the dress
You used to know
When my innocence
Was not for show
If I could punch your heart you'd dir
I'd put back every star
I've lost the heart to shine
Because I let you go
