[00:00.02] Do you still take a long time to get ready?
[00:06.67] 'Cause you used to make too much
[00:09.39] Out of that kind of stuff
[00:11.48] When you turn your head around
[00:13.84] And it kills
[00:16.88] 'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
[00:20.56] And it always will
[00:22.34] I wait a long time just to see you
[00:28.89] I'm happy to be catchin' up
[00:31.48] No, we don't have to patch things up
[00:33.36] Just turn the lights down for the thrill
[00:38.76] 'Cause the dress looks nice on you still
[00:42.39] And it always will
[00:44.24] So
[00:45.27] We should go out
[00:46.84] And dance like we used to dance
[00:50.47] We should go out
[00:52.35] And hold hands
[00:53.84] Lovers hold hands
[00:55.12] And I can't tell you who's gonna last
[01:00.07] Well maybe that's a question
[01:01.87] An answer I don't have
[01:05.00] (I can't tell)
[01:12.00] 
[01:10.90] Okay, I took a long time to get ready too
[01:17.57] 'Cause I didn't remember it
[01:19.68] And my hair got heavy like it tends to do
[01:22.41] And I know that ain't part of the deal
[01:27.95] But the dress looks nice on you still
[01:31.63] And it always will
[01:33.19] I hated myself for some time
[01:39.30] For the things that I said
[01:41.63] The things that I put in your head
[01:44.23] And I tried
[01:44.95] And I tried
[01:46.58] And I failed
[01:49.63] But the dress looks nice on you still
[01:53.42] And it always will
[01:55.11] So
[01:56.14] We should go out
[01:57.74] And dance like we used to dance
[02:01.58] We should go out
[02:03.22] And hold hands
[02:04.74] Lovers hold hands
[02:05.98] And I can't tell you who's gonna last
[02:10.90] Well maybe that's a question
[02:12.74] An answer I don't have
[02:16.50] Well maybe that's a question
[02:18.38] An answer I don't have
[02:22.10] Mm
[02:23.45] We should go out
[02:25.14] And dance like we used to dance
[02:28.82] We should go out
[02:30.54] And hold hands
[02:32.06] Lovers hold hands
[02:33.29] And I can't tell you who's gonna last
[02:38.29] Well maybe that's a question
[02:40.13] An answer I don't have
[02:44.01] Well maybe that's a question
[02:45.53] An answer I don't have
[02:56.53] 
[02:52.14] We should go out
[02:54.62] Said we should go out
[02:57.89] Go out
